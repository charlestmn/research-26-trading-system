# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Local git repository initialized and committed
❌ GitHub remote repository not yet created

## Manual Steps to Create GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `research-26-trading-system`
3. Description: `Research 26 - Institutional-grade AI-augmented hedge fund trading system with 4-pillar strategy framework. Target: Sharpe ≥5.0, CAGR ≥200%, Max DD ≤12%`
4. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-26-trading-system.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Your GitHub repository should now contain:
- README.md
- MISSION_STATEMENT.md  
- RISK_POLICY.md
- RUNBOOK.md
- TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- .github/workflows/main.yml
- src/ directory with core code
- .gitignore
- requirements.txt
- setup.py

## Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop
If you prefer a GUI:
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. File → Add Local Repository
3. Choose this folder
4. Publish repository to GitHub

## What's Already Done
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Core files committed (14 files, 2,734 lines)
✅ Professional .gitignore configured
✅ Clean commit history established

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup
1. Enable GitHub Actions (should auto-enable with the workflow file)
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Configure repository settings
4. Add collaborators if needed
