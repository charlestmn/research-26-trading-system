## 📁 FILE SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY

### GitHub as Single Source of Truth
All development progress, status updates, and documentation will be stored in GitHub to enable multi-computer development workflow.

**Key Documents (GitHub-Stored):**
- `R26_MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` (this file)
- `RESEARCH_26_COMPLETE_STATUS.md`
- All development scripts and models
- Configuration files and deployment scripts

**Local Files:** Only temporary development and testing
**AWS Files:** Runtime execution and data storage

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Current AWS Configuration
- **Instance Type:** t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Operating System:** Amazon Linux 2
- **Python Version:** 3.7
- **Storage:** 20GB EBS volume
- **Network:** Public IP with security groups

### Installed Dependencies
- pandas, numpy, scipy (data processing)
- scikit-learn (machine learning)
- alpaca-trade-api (trading interface)
- redis (caching/messaging)
- psycopg2-binary (database connectivity)
- yfinance 0.1.87 (market data - Python 3.7 compatible)

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical KPIs
- **Data Pipeline Uptime:** Target 99.5%
- **Model Training Speed:** Target <30 minutes per iteration
- **API Response Time:** Target <100ms
- **System Reliability:** Target 99.9% uptime

### Trading Performance KPIs
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Target >2.0
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Target <10%
- **Win Rate:** Target >60%
- **Annual Returns:** Target >30%

## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### Technical Risks
- **Data Quality:** Implement comprehensive validation
